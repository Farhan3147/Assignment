    "2. Customization: Constructors can accept parameters, enabling you to customize the initialization of each object.\n",
    "This allows you to create objects with different initial states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Automatically Invoked: Constructors are automatically called when you create an object of the class.\n",
    "You don't need to call them explicitly; Python takes care of this for you.\n",

    "# 15. Explain the concept of abstract data types (ADTs) and their role in achieving abstraction in Python.\n",

    "An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a programming concept that defines a high-level view of a data structure, without specifying \n",

    "interface of the structure, without specifying how it is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, ADTs are typically implemented using classes. The class serves as the template for the ADT, defining the structure \n",
    "of the data and the operations that can be performed on it. The class methods provide the interface through which users interact \n",
    "with the data, abstracting away the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how ADTs contribute to achieving abstraction in Python:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hiding Implementation Details:-\n",
    "ADTs encapsulate data and operations, hiding the internal representation and implementation details from the user. \n",

    "2. Promoting Code Reusability:-\n",

    "and drawbacks that developers need to be mindful of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Complexity:-\n",

    "\n",
    "Potential for Tight Coupling:- \n",
    "Composition can result in tight coupling between objects, especially if the containing object directly accesses and manipulates \n",

    "levels of composition involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Performance Overhead:- \n",

    "\n",
